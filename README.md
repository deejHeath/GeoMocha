GeoMocha has a Create button that opens a menu of things that you can create.  Among those things are points, including midpoints, intersections, points reflected (folded) over a line, and points inverted in a circle. Secondly, various types of lines bcan be created: segments, rays, lines, perpendicular lines, parallel lines, bisectors, and Beloch fold lines.  Thirdly, circles can be created, either by swiping from the center to a point on the circle or by choosing three points on the circle.  (If the three points are collinear, then the three point circle tool will create the line.)

Some things can be constructed by merely swiping, producing two points that define the construction.  Others require three points, and require that you select the points instead of swiping. Others require some construction to already be present.  For example, if you try to find the bisectors from two lines, but you have not yet constructed two lines, GeoMocha will respond by allowing you to construct lines.

GeoMocha has a Measure button that opens a menu of ways that you can measure things.  Among those things are distances, angle measures, area of a triangle, and area of a circle.  In addition, you can measure the sum, difference, product, and ratio of two measures, or the sine of cosine of a measure.  The Measure button also gives access to some extra tools: one that allows you to hide an object, another that toggles the label, another that lets you scale or translate your constructions, and lastly, one that sets up a particularly useful unit circle configuration.

Since distance is arbitrary in Euclidean geometry, the first distance measured will define the unit: it will be 1.  All other distances will be measured with that unit distance as the standard.  If you attempt to measure something else that requires the unit distance to already be chosen (such as area of a circle or triangle), GeoMocha will choose a unit distance first, and use it to calculate the measure in question.

GeoMocha has a Share button that allows you to share your image with others in your contact list.

GeoMocha has an Undo button that undoes whatever the last recorded action was.  Recorded actions are creations and hides; other actions can easily be undone by the user.

GeoMocha has a Clear button that resets everything.

GeoMocha has an Info button that gives information about GeoMocha.
